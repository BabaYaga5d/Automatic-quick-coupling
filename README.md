# Automatic Quick Coupling

This product was developed to aid in the reliable assembly of a gearbox onto a motor in a high-production-volume environment.

## Problem Statement

The motor shaft needs to be rotated continuously to make the assembly of the gearbox more reliable. The motor shaft is ground to a tolerance of 10 microns and has a cross-drilled hole located 40 mm from the tip. This operation must be performed without the workers using their hands, as the assembly process requires them to use both hands.

## Concept

The idea is to use the cross-drilled hole to drive the motor shaft. A bell crank mechanism is used such that the tip of the shaft actuates it, allowing a hook to engage with the hole.

Once the hooks are engaged, the shaft can be rotated by rotating the pivot about the same axis as the shaft.

## Geometry

The dimensions were solved graphically in CAD. Since the hole is located 40 mm from the tip, the hook must remain out of the way while the shaft is being inserted and should engage only after actuating the bell crank.

The blue rectangle represents the shaft after it actuates the bell crank.

## Design and Iterations

The core idea is to house the bell crank mechanism inside a cylindrical body. This cylinder can be mounted in a spindle assembly powered by a motor operating at the desired speed. The cylinder has a bore matching the shaft diameter to allow proper insertion of the shaft.

The first and third steps are designed to fit into a 17 mm bearing. The fourth step is used to couple the assembly to a motor. Slots are provided on both sides of the cylinder to allow the hooks to enter the bore and engage into the hole.

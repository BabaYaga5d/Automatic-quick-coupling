# Automatic Quick coupling

This was a product developed to aid in the assembly of gearbox onto a motor reliabily in a high production volume environment.

## Problem statement 

A motor needs its shaft to be roatated constantly to reduce the make the assembly of a gearbox more realiable. The motor shaft is ground to 10 micron and there is a cross drilled hole 40mm from the tip. This has to be done without the workers having to use their hands as the assembly requires them to use both hands.

## Concept

The idea is to use the crossdrilled hole to drive the motor shaft. A bellcrank is used so that the tip of the shaft can actuate it to engage hook into the hole.

With the hooks in place we the shaft can me rotated if the pivot is rotated arounf the same axis as the shaft

## Geometry

The dimensions are solved for graphically in CAD. The hole is 40mm from the tip and the hook has to be out of the way while shaft is coming in to actuate the bellcrank.

The blue rectangle represents the shaft after it actuates the bellcrank.

## Design and Iterations

The main idea is to house the bellcrank mechanism onto a cylinder which inturn can be placed in a spindle assembly power by some motor of desired speed. The cylinder will have a bore matching th Shaft dia to accept

The first and 3rd steps are make to fit into a 17mm bearing the 4th step is used to couple it to a motor. There are slots on both sides to allow the hooks to enter the bore.
